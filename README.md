![](https://github.com/YahboomTechnology/dofbot-jetson_nano/blob/master/DOFBOT.jpg)
# Introduction
DOFBOT is the best partner for AI beginners, programming enthusiasts and Jetson nano fans. It is designed based on Jetson NANO 4GB and contains 6 HQ servos, a HD camera and a multi-function expansion board. The whole body is made of green oxidized aluminum alloy, which is beautiful and durable. Through the ROS robot system, we simplify the motion control of serial bus servo. We adopt Open Source CV as the image processing library and Python3 programming language to create a series of AI visual game play. For example, color tracking, color interaction, garbage classification, gesture recognition, face tracking, etc. And it can be controlled by Android/iOS mobile APP, PC computer and game handle. In addition, we will provide some tutorials for reference. 

# Features
